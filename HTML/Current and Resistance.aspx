            An electric current is a flow of charged particles, such as electrons or ions, moving through an electrical conductor or space.
            It is defined as the net rate of flow of electric charge through a surface.  The moving particles are called charge carriers, which may be one of several types of particles, depending on the conductor.
            In electric circuits the charge carriers are often electrons moving through a wire. In semiconductors they can be electrons or holes.
            In an electrolyte the charge carriers are ions, while in plasma, an ionized gas, they are ions and electrons.
